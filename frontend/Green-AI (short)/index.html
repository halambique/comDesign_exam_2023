          From smart homes to smart cities, adaptive technologies are an ever-increasing part of our lives. The communications networks controlling these are largely invisible, and the devices often resemble their predecessors, from light-bulbs controlled by apps to industrial plants optimizing production processes - they mostly look like light-bulbs and the same old factories to the lay-person.

While including the energy cost of personal devices and network communications, how can the IT industry claim to be green?
